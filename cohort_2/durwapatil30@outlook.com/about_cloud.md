# Disaster Recovery :-

- Cloud disaster recovery (cloud DR) is a combination of strategies and services intended to back up data,applications and other resources to public cloud or dedicated service providers.

- When disaster occurs, the affected data, applications and other resources can be restored to the local data center -- or a cloud provider -- and resume normal operation for the enterprise.

## Selecting a cloud DR provider :-

Selecting a cloud DR provider typically involves six separate considerations: location, reliability, scalability, security and compliance.

- First, a business must consider the cloud DR provider's physical distance and latency -- putting DR too close increases the risk of shared physical disaster, but putting the DR too far away increases latency and network congestion,making it harder to access DR content.

- Location can be particularly tricky when the DR content must be accessible from numerous global business locations.

- Next, consider the cloud DR provider's reliability. Even a cloud experiences downtime, and service downtime during a recovery can be equally disastrous for the business.

- Also, consider the scalability of the cloud DR offering.It must be able to protect selected data, applications and other resources, but it must also be able to accommodate additional resources as needed and be able to provide adequate performance as other global customers use the services.

- Understand the security requirements of the DR contentand be sure that the provider can offer authentication, virtual private networks (VPNs), encryption and other toolsneeded to safeguard the business's valuable resources.

- Finally, consider how the DR platform must be architected.There are three fundamental approaches to DR: cold, warm and hot. These terms loosely relate to the ease with which asystem can be recovered.

#### Cold DR :-

- Cold DR typically involves storage of data or virtual machine (VM) images. These resources generally aren't usable without additional work such as downloading the stored data or loading the image into a VM.

- Cold DR is usually the simplest approach -- often just storage -- and least-expensive approach, but it takes the longest to recover, leaving the business with the longest downtime in a disaster.

#### Warm DR :-

- Warm DR is generally a standby approach where duplicate data and applications are placed with a cloud DR provider and kept up to date with data and applications in the primary data center. But the duplicate resources aren't doing any processing.

- When disaster strikes, the warm DR can be brought online to resume operations from the DR provider -- often a matter of starting a VM and redirecting IP addresses and traffic to the DR resources. Recovery can be quite short, but still imposes some downtime for the protected workloads.

#### Hot DR :-

- Hot DR is typically a live parallel deployment of data and workloads running together in tandem. That is, both the primary data center and the DR site use the same workload and data running in synchronization -- both sites sharing part of the overall application traffic.

- When disaster strikes one site, the remaining site continues without disruption to handle the work. Users are ideally unaware of the disruption. Hot DR has no downtime but can be the most expensive and complicated approach.

# Benefits of cloud DR :-

1. Pay-as-you-go options :-)  
          Organizations that deployed do-it-yourself (DIY)  DR facilities faced significant capital costs, while engaging managed colocation 
   providers for off-site DR services often locked organizations into long-term service agreements.                   

2. Flexibility and scalability :-)  
          Traditional DR approaches, usually implemented in local or remote data centers, often imposed limitations in flexibility and 
   scalability.

# What is Capital expenditure (CapEx) ?

##### Ans.

- Capital expenditure occurs when the company acquires new assets or adds some value to the existing one which would be useful beyond the current financial year.

- Capex or expenses are depreciated or amortized over a span of years. For example, it can buy equipment/ buildings or add value to an existing asset to upgrade beyond the current financial year.

- Once the asset is put to use, it is depreciated over the period of time to spread the cost of the asset over its useful span of life. Every year, a part of the asset is put to use.

- Depreciation is the amount of depletion on the fixed asset, and the amount of depreciation which happens each year is used as a tax deduction.

- Most often capital expenses are mostly depreciated over a five to ten years period, but sometimes may be depreciated over twenty years in the case of real estate properties.

- Capital expenditure is therefore used for a future benefit like for the growth of the company.

# What is Operational expenditure (OpeEx)?

##### Ans. 

- Opex refers to those expenses that a business has to incur to run the daily operations. For example, the wages of the employees, leases, maintenance and repair cost, etc.

- Operating expenses are completely tax-deductible. Therefore it is more attractive for a company to lease an item and assign its cost to operating expenses rather than purchase it.

## Capex vs Opex Infographics

Let’s see the top differences between Capex vs Opex.

## Key Differences

- As capital expenses involve the purchase of assets that have a useful life beyond the current accounting year, these expenses cannot be recovered in the year in which capital expenses are purchased.  
  Instead, the assets are capitalized and either amortized or depreciated over the life of the assets depending on whether it is tangible or intangible assets.  
  Intangible assets like patents are amortized and tangible assets like buildings or equipment’s are depreciated over their lifespan.  

- Operating expenditure, on the other side, can be fully deducted in the current accounting year.  
  By deducted it means, the operating expenses can be subtracted from the revenue when estimating the profit/loss of the company.  
  As companies are usually taxed on the profit Operating expenditure make therefore the number of expenses you deduct will impact the tax one has to pay.  

- However tax deductible is not always the sole purpose for all the companies. If a company wants to increase its earnings, it may opt for capital expenditure instead and only subtract a small part of it as an expense over a span of years.  
  This will amount to a higher value of assets on its balance sheet and also an increase in net income that it can show to the investors. It will eventually increase the valuation of the company and also its stock price.

## IT Spending – CapEx or OpEx ?

- Traditionally technology investments most often were considered for capital expenditures over OpEx, because CFOs could take advantage of amortization these expenses over an extended period of time.

- Nowadays, more and more companies switch IT investment from CapEx to OpEx and they have a reasonable argument for this switch – moving company IT infrastructure to the cloud.

- Once this moving happens, additional CapEx benefits fall as far as the company no longer need static investments for the hardware, software and resources.

- Services and options are purchased as needed, costs are fluctuating and OpEx works better for such expenses type and supports necessary scalability.
