## What is Internet of Things (IoT)?

 - Internet of Things, is a system of internet connected connected computing devices, mechanical and digital machines or objects that have the ability to transfer data over a private network resulting in reduced human efforts and a number of other advantages.

 - Thanks to some brilliant minds, computer chips and wireless networks, we can turn anything (possibly) into a part of IoT.

 - With Arduino, different sensors and motors, we can add sone digital intelligence to dumb things, also enabling them to communicate, collect data or work for us without involving humans;the possibilities are endless.

 - A interesting example of IoT device is Amazon Echo and many other smart speakers. It makes easier for people to play music, sounds amazing right!!

 - Another example is Smart Honw Lights. With a simple touch or voice command, network connection, Smart LED lights can be turned on/off or their colour could be changed.

 - IoT platform grants the user to control the IoT devices safely, wherever you are.

## Why is IoT so important?

 - Let's start with a simple examples:

 - Say you're a manager in big pharmaceutical industry and the responsibility of monitoring thw temperature of a given drug rests on your shoulders.

 - The Government has decided the threshold limit values of the drug, such that the temperature should not strictly exceed these limits, else your company might face a big loss.

 - A smart **Arduino and Sensor** would make it easier for you to continuously monitor these temperatures as ut would alert you by sending a pop-up message on your device if the temperature is about to exceed the set limits.

 - Also **self-driving cars, smart cities, etc** just to name a few.

 - Many organizations use different approach with the help of IoT to operate more efficiently, to improve, monitor or to change decision making.

### Benefits of having IoT devices around us! 

 - **Productively improvement**: Monitoring and control of the different processes improves the different operations that increase productivity and efficiency. 

 - **Predictive analysis**: IoT's new technologies make it possible to examine recurring patterns and predicts irregularities. 

 - **Rapid response**: The data makes it possible to monitor the system in place, in real time and even remotely, giving the company a strategic advantage in monitoring market developments. 

 - **Reduction of human errors**: Artificial Intelligence in IoT makes it possible to reduce human errors due to work load or repetitive tasks. 

 - **Saves time and money**

 - **Enhances productivity**

 - **Encourages new technologies and business models**.

 - **Internet of Things** is big and getting bigger, and the benefits are countless, depending on particular implementation, improving efficiency wherever it is utilized.
