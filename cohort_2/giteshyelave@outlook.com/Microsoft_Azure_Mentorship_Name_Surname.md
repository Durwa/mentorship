- Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform.

- It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking.

- Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.

- The Azure platform aims to help businesses manage challenges and meet their organizational goals. It offers tools that support all industries -- including e-commerce, finance and a variety of Fortune 500 companies -- and is compatible with open source technologies.This provides users with the flexibility to use their preferred tools and technologies.

- In addition, Azure offers 4 different forms of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and serverless.

- Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources they have used.

## How does Microsoft Azure work ?

- Once customers subscribe to Azure, they have access to all the services included in the Azure portal. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VM) and databases.

- In addition to the services that Microsoft offers through the Azure portal, a number of third-party vendors also make software directly available through Azure.

- The cost billed for third-party applications varies widely but may involve paying a subscription fee for the application, plus a usage fee for the infrastructure used to host the application.

- Microsoft provides five different customer support options for Azure:

1.Basic

2.Developer

3.Standard

4.Professional Direct

5.Premier

- These customer support plans vary in terms of scope and price. Basic support is available to all Azure accounts, but Microsoft charges a fee for the other support offerings.

- Developer support costs $29 per month, while Standard support costs $100 per month and Professional Direct support is $1000 per month.

- Microsoft does not disclose the pricing for Premier support.
