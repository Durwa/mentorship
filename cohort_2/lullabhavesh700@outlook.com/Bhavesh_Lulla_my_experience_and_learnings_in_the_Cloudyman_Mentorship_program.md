## Internet of Things (IoT) 

   The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects--"things"-- that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025.

## Why is IoT so important? 

   Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects--kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors--to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things. 

   By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world--and they cooperate. 

## What technologies have made IoT possible? 

   While the idea of IoT has been in existence for a long time, a collection of recent advances in a number of different technologies has made it practical. 

 - **Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology.** Affordable and reliable sensors are making IoT technology possible for more manufacturers.
