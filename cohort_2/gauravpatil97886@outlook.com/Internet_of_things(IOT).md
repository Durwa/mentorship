# Introduction to Internet of things(IOT):

=================================================

![](https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/What-to-Expect-from-a-Modern-IoT-Platform-in-2019.jpg)

---------
##### (The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded 
##### computing devices within the existing Internet infrastructure)
-----------


- Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment.

- In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, 
and smart homes are just a very few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established

-  ****Over 9 billion**** ‘Things’ (physical objects) are currently connected to the Internet, 
as of now. In the near future, this number is expected to rise to a whopping 20 billion.
------------


------
## There are four main components used in IoT:
------

 ****1.Low-power embedded systems****–

- Less battery consumption, high performance are the inverse factors play a significant role during the design of electronic systems.


****2.Cloud computing**** –

- Data collected through IoT devices is massive and this data has to be stored on a reliable storage server.
This is where cloud computing comes into play. The data is processed and learned, giving more room 
for us to discover where things like electrical faults/errors are within the system.

****3.Av**ailability of big data****–

- We know that IoT relies heavily on sensors, 
especially real-time. As these electronic devices spread throughout every field, their usage is going to trigger a massive flux of big data.

****4.Networking connection****–

- In order to communicate, interne
- In order to communicate, internet connectivity is a must where each physical object is 
represented by an IP address. However, there are only a limited number of addresses available according to the IP naming. Due to the growing number of devices, this naming system will not be feasible anymore. Therefore, researchers are looking for another alternative naming system to represent each physical object

------------

------
## There are two ways of building IoT:
------

- Form a separate internetwork including only physical objects.

- Make the Internet ever more expansive, but this requires hard-core technologies such as rigorous cloud computing
and rapid **big data storage (expensive)**.

- In the near future, IoT will become broader and more complex in terms of scope. It will change the world in terms of

### 1.IoT Enablers –

**RFIDs:**** uses radio waves in order to electronically track the tags attached to each physical object.

****Sensors:**** devices that are able to detect changes in an environment (ex: motion detectors).

****Nanotechnology****: as the name suggests, these are extremely small devices with dimensions usually less than a hundred nanometers.

****Smart networks****: (ex: mesh topology).

----------

## Characteristics of IoT:


- Massively scalable and efficient

- 
- IP-based addressing will no longer be suitable in the upcoming future.

- An abundance of physical objects is present that does not use IP, so IoT is made possible.

- Devices typically consume less power. When not in use, they should be automatically programmed to sleep.

- A device that is connected to another device right now may not be connected in another instant of time.

- ****Intermittent connectivity**** – IoT devices aren’t always connected. In order to save bandwidth and battery consumption,
- devices will be powered off periodically when not in use. Otherwise, connections might turn unreliable and thus prove to be inefficient.

## Modern Applications:

#### Smart Grids

#### Smart cities

#### Smart homes

#### Healthcare

#### Earthquake detection

#### Radiation detection/hazardous gas detection

#### Smartphone detection

# Why IoT Matters?


- ###When something is connected to the internet, that means that it can send information or receive information, or both. This ability to send and/or receive information makes things “smart."


- Let’s use ****smartphones**** again as an example. 

- Right now you can listen to just about any song in the world, but it’s not because your phone actually has every song in the world stored on it. It’s because every song in the world is stored somewhere else, but your phone can send information (asking for that song) and then receive information (streaming that song on your phone).

- To be smart, a thing doesn't need to have super storage or a super computer inside of it - it just needs access to it. All a thing has to do is connect to super storage or to a super computer. In the Internet of Things, all the things that are being connected to the internet can be put into three categories:

- Things that collect information and then send it.

- Things that receive information and then act on it.


- Things that do both.
And all ****three of these have enormous benefits that compound on each other****.

---------

#### 1. Collecting and Sending Information

- ****Sensors could be temperature sensors****, motion sensors, moisture sensors, air quality sensors, light sensors, you name it. These sensors, along with a connection, allow us to automatically collect information from the environment which, in turn, allows us to make more intelligent decisions.

- On a farm, automatically getting information about the soil moisture can tell farmers exactly when their crops need to be watered. Instead of watering too much (which can be an expensive over-use of irrigation systems) or watering too little (which can be an expensive loss of crops), the farmer can ensure that crops get exactly the right amount of water. This enables farmers to increase their crop yield while decreasing their associated expenses.

- Just as our sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste allow us, humans, to make sense of the world, sensors allow machines (and the humans monitoring the machines) to make sense of the world.

----------

#### 2. Receiving and Acting on Information

- We’re all very ****familiar with machines**** getting information and then acting. Your printer receives a document and it prints it. Your car receives a signal from your car keys and the doors open. The examples are endless.

- Whether it’s a simple as sending the command “turn on” or as complex as sending a 3D model to a 3D printer, we know that we can tell machines what to do from far away. So what?

- The real power of the Internet of Things arises when things can do both of the above. Things that collect information and send it, but also receive information and act on it.

-------------


#### 3. Doing Both: The Goal of an IoT System

- Let’s quickly go back to the farming example. The sensors can collect information about the soil moisture to tell the farmer how much to water the crops, but you don’t actually need the farmer. Instead, the irrigation system can automatically turn on as needed, based on how much moisture is in the soil.

- You can take it a step further too. If the irrigation system receives information about the weather from its internet connection, it can also know when it’s going to rain and decide not to water the crops today because they’ll be watered by the rain anyways.

- And it doesn’t stop there! All this information about the soil moisture, how much the irrigation system is watering the crops, and how well the crops actually grow can be collected and sent to supercomputers that run amazing algorithms that can make sense of all this information.

- And that’s just one kind of sensor. Add in other sensors like light, air quality, and temperature, and these algorithms can learn much, much more. With dozens, hundreds, thousands of farms all collecting this information, these algorithms can create incredible insights into how to make crops grow the best, helping to feed the world.

****And agriculture is just one of many applications of IoT…****

#### 3. IoT Applications – Health Care

IoT applications can turn reactive medical-based systems into proactive wellness-based systems.

The resources that current medical research uses, lack critical real-world information. It mostly uses leftover data, controlled environments, and volunteers for medical examination. IoT opens ways to a sea of valuable data through analysis, real-time field data, and testing. 

The Internet of Things also improves the current devices in power, precision, and availability. IoT focuses on creating systems rather than just equipment.

Here’s how an IoT-enabled care device works.

#### 4. IoT Applications – Smart Cities

By now I assume, most of you must have heard about the term Smart City. The hypothesis of the optimized traffic system I mentioned earlier, is one of the many aspects that constitute a smart city.

The thing about the smart city concept is that it’s very specific to a city. The problems faced in Mumbai are very different than those in Delhi. The problems in Hong Kong are different from New York. Even global issues, like finite clean drinking water, deteriorating air quality and increasing urban density, occur in different intensities across cities. Hence, they affect each city differently.

The Government and engineers can use IoT to analyze the often-complex factors of town planning specific to each city. The use of IoT applications can aid in areas like water management, waste control, and emergencies.
. They realized, most cars on the streets go around and round the same block, in search of parking spots. That’s the main reason for traffic congestion in the city.

Thus, sensors were installed at all the parking spots around the city. These sensors pass the occupancy status of each spot to the cloud. Any number of applications can consume that data. It can guide the drivers through the shortest route to an open spot.

#### 5. IoT Applications – Agriculture

Statistics estimate the ever-growing world population to reach nearly 10 billion by the year 2050. To feed such a massive population one needs to marry agriculture to technology and obtain best results. There are numerous possibilities in this field. One of them is the**
****Smart Greenhouse*.

![](https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/iot4.png)

A greenhouse farming technique enhances the yield of crops by controlling environmental parameters. However, manual handling results in production loss, energy loss, and labor cost, making the process less effective.

A greenhouse with embedded devices not only makes it easier to be monitored but also, enables us to control the climate inside it. Sensors measure different parameters according to the plant requirement and send it to the cloud. It, then, processes the data and applies a control action.

In just 1-year internet connected devices went from 5 million to billions. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that 24 billion IoT devices would be installed by the year 2020, generating a revenue of over 300 billion.

IoT iterates, improves and keeps building. Its networks don’t arrive pre-assembled, they grow over time. The Internet of Things (IoT) has amalgamated hardware and software to the internet to create a smarter world. It has been growing at a significant pace and offers a multitude of opportunities for government and business. In fact, the number of openings for IoT professionals is at an all-time high.

## Advantages of IoT

Internet of things facilitates the several advantages in day-to-day life in the business sector. Some of its benefits are given below:

- ****Efficient resource utilization****: If we know the functionality and the way that how each device work we definitely increase the efficient resource utilization as well as monitor natural resources

- ****Minimize human effort****: As the devices of IoT interact and communicate with each other and do lot of task for us, then they minimize the human effort.

- ****Save time****: As it reduces the human effort then it definitely saves out time. Time is the primary factor which can save through IoT platform.

- ****Enhance Data Collection:****
Improve security: Now, if we have a system that all these things are interconnected then we can make the system more secure and efficient

- ****Improve security***: Now, if we have a system that all these things are interconnected then we can make the system more secure and efficient

-----------

## Disadvantages of IoT..

As the Internet of things facilitates a set of benefits, it also creates a significant set of challenges. Some of the IoT challenges are given below:

- ****Security:**** As the IoT systems are interconnected and communicate over networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures, and it can be lead the various kinds of network attacks.

***Privacy:**** Even without the active participation on the user, the IoT system provides substantial personal data in maximum detail
.
- ****Complexity:**** The designing, developing, and maintaining and enabling the large technology to IoT system is quite complicated.

-----------

## IoT technology and service

- Sensors play a critical role in the internet of things (IoT). Sensors collect data on the Internet by smart devices, which are then used to upload information to the cloud. To achieve this, sensors are embedded in physical devices or exist in the form of external devices. Sensing technology is utilized to acquire a broad range of information, such as position, motion, images, etc. They can also collect surrounding environmental data, including temperature, humidity, heat, atmosphere composition, light, and sound. The IoT is also used to remotely control air conditioning, heating, and lighting. It is important to note that many physical sensors are also evolving into smart sensors with built-in standard interfaces for improving information-processing capabilities and applicable functions. Sensors can also include virtual sensing functions that extract specific information from the sensed and accumulated data. Moreover, virtual sensing technology can be implemented in the actual IoT service interface. Using multidisciplinary sensor technology, which is one-dimensional higher than existing independent sensors, it is also possible to extract more intelligent and high-dimensional information.

For the connection of sensors, the network interface plays the role of connecting physical network devices. For wired and wireless IoT networks, physical devices include wireless personal area networks (WPAN), Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, LTE, Bluetooth, Ethernet, broadband convergence network (BcN), satellite communication, microwaves, serial communication, and PLC. These and other advanced communications systems enable the possibility for people, things, and services to become closely and rapidly connected.

The devices, such as sensors and network modules, are fixed on terminal devices for the collection of data. In other words, the development of sensor technology is essential to collect and extract data from objects. In addition, it is obviously necessary for network modules to communicate with these sensors, constituting an interworking of Internet communication, an application system, and an embedded system for providing user interfaces (UI). For activating the IoT, optimization and evolution of network technology are very important. The IoT can be connected to a network in a variety of ways. For example, things can be directly connected to a wireless network or connected to a smartphone through communication systems, such as Bluetooth. In the case of non-portable products, it can be connected to a protocol such as Wi-Fi, which is fixed in a certain place, such as a smart home or Industry 4.0.

It is important to note that the IoT service interface differs from traditional network interfaces. The primary aim of the IoT service interface is to offer value-added services through transformation, processing, extraction, and accumulation of sensed data. Additionally, it must make it possible to judge, contextualize, recognize, protect privacy, ensure security, authenticate, allow, discover, shape, etc., for the creation of services. The IoT service interface interlocks three major components: people, things, and services. For the application services to perform specific functions, the IoT must provide some interfaces for accumulating, processing, and transforming data for services, such as ontology-based semantics, open-sensor APIs, augmentation, virtualization, location identification, process management, open platform technology, etc.

The new types of value chains can be created based on the sensor devices, networks, and services in the IoT environment. This means that it can create new types of services that are based on different types of value chains on a data platform that is based on the particular device’s sensing technology. The IoT contributes greatly to the derivation and creation of services based on connections between devices, things, and people. Ultimately, the created services, operations, and products will be based on convergence between data and services using data collected through sensors.

The processed data can also be accumulated in a cloud computing environment as big data. It is obviously critical to integrate data collected from distributed things through the IoT for the creation of advanced services. To achieve this, a data platform that can integrate distributed, collected, and aggregated data is requisite. This platform enables the creation of services that can generate value from different types of data. Service applications on such a data platform are introduced in the next section.

# Hardware security in the IoT



According to a McKinsey study, security and privacy are seen as the critical challenges to IoT growth in the future[1]. A key focus area is the security of IoT devices that are accessible by end users. These devices can be found in applications ranging from commercial networked HVAC systems and wireless base stations to industrial power-line communications (PLC), avionics networking, and network gateway systems, as well as critical energy infrastructure at power stations.

Threat vectors are both real and hypothetical. Software security, alone, has proven inadequate to protect against known threats, but now today’s FPGA SoCs can be used to implement a scalable security scheme that extends all the way down to the IC level. They help deliver the full range of scalable security while maintaining low power system operation in a small footprint.

Virtually any device that is connected to other devices and accessible to end users presents a danger.

For instance, in the automotive space, a fake advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) message sent to an interconnected vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure (together known as V2X) system could cause accidents by providing false data about the speed and direction of oncoming traffic. Or, malicious data manipulation might cause traffic outages and associated chaos throughout the city.

In the industrial environment, the user-accessible equipment most likely to provide an open door to malicious attacks includes smart grid field controllers and utility flow monitors. A growing number of these remote products are becoming networked and, given their normally remote proximity, these are attractive to malicious hacking. An attack vector in the healthcare industry is user-accessible devices associated with patient monitoring. In the communications infrastructure, wireless small cell systems for 4G/LTE networks are similarly vulnerable, as they are generally installed at street level in outdoor deployments, and often via third-party access provider networks with less stringent security than the larger carriers. These devices are easy prey for hackers and vandals, who can use them to access networks that are extremely vulnerable to GPS jamming, spoofing, and other timing security breaches.

One of the most recent, high-profile examples of threats associated with user-accessible networked devices is when a hacker allegedly took control of a commercial airline flight[2]. According to court documents, the FBI is investigating whether a passenger gained access to the in-flight entertainment (IFE) systems by plugging his laptop into the electronic box mounted under his seat, and then accessing other systems including the jet’s thrust management computer, which is responsible for providing power to the plane’s engines.

In addition to the aforementioned threats, any user-accessible device is also vulnerable to intellectual property (IP) theft and reverse-engineering of the product. Protecting these devices from IP theft, reverse-engineering, tampering, and cloning, while also preventing their exploitation for network attacks, requires end-to-end, layered security beginning at the device level. Today’s FPGAs support this strategy through a combination of design security (chip level protection including anti-tamper measures), hardware security (board-level and the supply chain), and data security (spanning all communications to/from devices).

When a networked device without sufficient hardware security is hacked by an end-user, IP theft of the design can occur. Protecting IP is one example of design security. Design security also includes the ability to prevent someone from reverse engineering a product. Without hardware-based security, a user-accessible product can have its IP stolen. In 2012, the American Superconductor Corp.’s (AMSC)’s value experienced a drop of 40 percent in a single day, and 84 percent in a period of five months, due mainly to the company’s lack of security around their wind turbines’ algorithms[3].

To secure a design, configuration bit streams should be encrypted and protected. Devices that have tamper protection, zeroization, and secure key storage can significantly reduce the chances of a successful attack. The hardware should be able to identify unauthorized access and tampering, and zeroize when tampering is detected. Even better, the hardware security device should be resistant against differential power analysis (DPA) attacks. DPA is a technique by which with an inexpensive electromagnetic probe and a simple oscilloscope the encryption keys can be detected. Look to use hardware devices that have DPA licensed countermeasures to ensure you have adequate design security.

Another reason to secure an accessible product is because of hardware security. Examples of hardware security include ensuring the code the board is running is authentic and the supply chain that built the product is secured. A root of trust is the starting point for hardware security. A root of trust is a hardware device that you build from. It should have all the features of design security that were previously mentioned. With an established hardware root of trust, then higher-level security functions can really be used safely. For example, a hardware root of trust device could be used to store keys and encrypt the data that a processor would boot from. Secure boot is important for protecting the start-up code from attacks. If hackers were to access such a product they would not be able to over-write the boot code, nor could they install any malware for the processor to run. Figure 1 shows an example of how a processor can be secured using this approach.
