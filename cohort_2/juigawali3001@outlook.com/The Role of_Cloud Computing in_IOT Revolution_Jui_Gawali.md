# The role of cloud computing in IOT Revolution:
> The internet of Things is starting to transform daily tasks are completed. The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of everyday objects â€“ physical devices, vehicles, buildings etc. with embedded electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, allowing them to collect, send and receive data.

> The IoT generates a vast amount of Big Data and this in turn puts a huge strain on Internet Infrastructure. As a result, this forces companies to find solutions to minimise the pressure and solve their problem of transferring large amounts of data. 
Cloud computing has entered the mainstream of information technology, providing scalability in delivery of enterprise applications and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
Companies are now migrating their information operations to the cloud. Many cloud providers can allow for your data to be either transferred via your traditional internet 
connection or via a dedicated direct link. The benefit of a direct link into the cloud will ensure that your data is uncontended and that the traffic is not crossing the 
internet and the Quality of Service can be controlled. 

## Difference Between Cloud Computing and IOT:
Cloud computing in simple terms means accessing data and programs from a centralised pool of compute resource that can be ordered and consumed on demand. Typically clouds 
deployments are described in 3 different models; Public, Private or Hybrid. 

- Private Cloud Services is a secure cloud that only the specified organisation can access. The additional security offered by a private cloud model is ideal for any organisation, 
including enterprise, that needs to store and process private data or carry out sensitive tasks. For example, a private cloud service could be utilised by a financial company that
is required by regulation to store sensitive data internally and who will still want to benefit from some of the advantages of cloud computing within their business infrastructure,
such as on demand resource allocation.
- Public Cloud Service is like a Private cloud although the main differentiator is that resources used to process and store data can be shared with other organisations, and data 
transferred over a public network such as the internet. Third party providers will deliver cloud services over the internet and are normally charged by CPU cycles, storage, or 
bandwidth that they require.
- Hybrid Cloud is a cloud computing environment which uses a mix of on premise, private cloud and third party public cloud services. With the hybrid cloud model, IT decision 
makers have more control over both the private and public components than using a pre-packaged public cloud platform.
> The internet of Things, meanwhile refers to the connection of devices other than the usual such as computers to the Internet. Cars, kitchen appliances and other sensors can be connected through the IoT. The IoT is an enabler for change. 
It enables systems and devices to be automated in a cost effective, intelligent manner supporting real-time control and monitoring. Having all the relevant information available 
(real time along with historical trend data) provides the ability to combine and process this data in an innovative manner resulting in more effective and efficient control or 
decision making.

## How Cloud Computing Complements IOT Initiatives:
Cloud computing and the IoT both serve to increase efficiency in everyday tasks and both have a complementary relationship.  The IoT generates massive amounts of data, and cloud
computing provides a pathway for this data to travel. 

Many Cloud providers charge on a pay per use model, which means that you only pay for the computer resources that you use and not more. Economies of scale is another way in which cloud providers can benefit smaller IoT start-ups and reduce overall costs to IoT companies. 

Another benefit of Cloud Computing for the IoT is that Cloud Computing enables better collaboration which is essential for developers today. By allowing developers to store and access data remotely, developers can access data immediately and work on projects without delay.

Finally by storing data in the Cloud, this enables IoT companies to change directly quickly and allocate resources in different areas. Big Data has emerged in the past couple of years and with such emergence the cloud has become the architecture of choice. Most companies find it feasible to access the massive quantities of Big Data via the cloud.

# What is IOT(Internet of Things)?

- The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

- A thing in the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address and is able to transfer data over a network.

- Increasingly, organizations in a variety of industries are using IoT to operate more efficiently, better understand customers to deliver enhanced customer service, improve decision-making and increase the value of the business.

# How IOT Works?
> An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors and communication hardware, to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices -- for instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data.
The connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices largely depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.
IoT can also make use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to aid in making data collecting processes easier and more dynamic.

# How IOT is important?
- The internet of things helps people live and work smarter, as well as gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, IoT is essential to business. IoT provides businesses with a real-time look into how their systems really work, delivering insights into everything from the performance of machines to supply chain and logistics operations.

- IoT enables companies to automate processes and reduce labor costs. It also cuts down on waste and improves service delivery, making it less expensive to manufacture and deliver goods, as well as offering transparency into customer transactions.

- As such, IoT is one of the most important technologies of everyday life, and it will continue to pick up steam as more businesses realize the potential of connected devices to keep them competitive.

# IOT Benefits to organization:
> The internet of things offers several benefits to organizations. Some benefits are industry-specific, and some are applicable across multiple industries. Some of the common benefits of IoT enable businesses to:

- monitor their overall business processes;
- improve the customer experience (CX);
- save time and money;
- enhance employee productivity;
- integrate and adapt business models;
- make better business decisions; and
- generate more revenue.
> IoT encourages companies to rethink the ways they approach their businesses and gives them the tools to improve their business strategies.
Generally, IoT is most abundant in manufacturing, transportation and utility organizations, making use of sensors and other IoT devices; however, it has also found use cases for organizations within the agriculture, infrastructure and home automation industries, leading some organizations toward digital transformation.

> IoT can benefit farmers in agriculture by making their job easier. Sensors can collect data on rainfall, humidity, temperature and soil content, as well as other factors, that would help automate farming techniques.

> The ability to monitor operations surrounding infrastructure is also a factor that IoT can help with. Sensors, for example, could be used to monitor events or changes within structural buildings, bridges and other infrastructure. This brings benefits with it, such as cost saving, saved time, quality-of-life workflow changes and paperless workflow.

> A home automation business can utilize IoT to monitor and manipulate mechanical and electrical systems in a building. On a broader scale, smart cities can help citizens reduce waste and energy consumption.

> IoT touches every industry, including businesses within healthcare, finance, retail and manufacturing.
